# Chat Server (Work in progress)

A multi-threaded chat server that allows clients to connect and message concurrently.

The purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of multi-threading and socket programming in C/C++.

## Sockets

A subdirectory with code demonstrating simple socket programming in C

## Threads

A subdirectory with code demonstrating simple multi-threading in C++

## Design Scope

The chat server will support group chat for up to 4 users at a time. The system will only support text messages. Text length should be at most 1024 characters. End-to-end encryption will not be required (for now). The chat history should be stored until the server shuts down.
